##Firstly, you no longer need to commit() changes you make; theyâ€™re automatically saved. Using "with" also helps to handle potential errors and frees up resources that are no longer needed - much like how we can open (and automatically close) files using the "with" keyword.
##
##Keep in mind, however, that you will still need to commit() a change if you want to see the result of that change immediately (before closing the connection).
